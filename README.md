This CSS stylesheet customizes the **Media Bar plugin** for the **ScyFin theme** in Jellyfin.
It enlarges and rounds visual elements for a smoother appearance while removing all media control buttons for a cleaner, more minimal interface.

Main changes include:

* Complete removal of play, detail, and favorite buttons
* Rounded corners for backdrops and containers
* Adjusted gradient masks for a softer visual effect
* Improved layout positioning across desktop and mobile views

Designed to enhance the ScyFin theme with a modern, minimal, and elegant look.

⚠️ Disclaimer

I did not create this code.
It was made using the information I had, combined with the CSS from ScyFin, the Media Bar plugin, and assistance from ChatGPT.
I claim no credit for this work — it is simply a functional combination and adjustment of existing resources.
